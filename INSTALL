======================
= Installing Atrinik =
======================

 This document explains how to compile Atrinik from sources.

 !!!
 !!! If you're compiling from a Git repository, make sure you have
 !!! performed the following command beforehand:
 !!! $ git submodule init
 !!!

 Follow sections 1.x for GNU/Linux installation instructions, or sections 2.x
 for Windows instructions.

 Refer to the README files located in the server/client directories for
 execution instructions.

=================================
= 1.1 Prerequisites (GNU/Linux) =
=================================

 Several libraries and programs are needed in order to compile and/or run
 Atrinik:
  - CMake: Required
  - Flex: Required
  - cURL: Required
  - zlib: Required
  - OpenSSL: Required
  - Check: Optional (only if you plan on doing development, required for
                     running unit tests)

 The Atrinik server needs the following libraries/programs:
  - GD Graphics Library: Optional (if you want to generate region maps --
                                   usually a good idea)
  - Python: Required (optional for merely compiling the server at this time,
                      but not for playing)
  - Readline: Optional (nicer CLI console with history and auto-completion)

 The Atrinik client needs the following libraries/programs:
  - SDL: Required
  - SDL_image: Required
  - SDL_mixer: Optional, if not installed sound support will not be
               available.
  - SDL_ttf: Required
  - Timidity: Optional, necessary to play MIDI background music files
  - libx11, libxmu: Optional, necessary for clipboard support

 You can use the following command on Debian-based systems to install all the
 recommended packages:
  # apt-get install build-essential openssl-dev cmake zlib1g-dev \
    libcurl4-openssl-dev python3-dev libgd-dev check libreadline6-dev \
    libsdl-image1.2-dev libsdl-mixer1.2-dev libsdl1.2-dev libsdl-ttf2.0-dev \
    timidity libsdl1.2debian libsdl1.2debian-all libx11-dev libxmu-dev

===============================
= 1.2 Compilation (GNU/Linux) =
===============================

 Once you have installed the prerequisites, generate the project Makefiles
 with CMake:
  $ cmake .

 Afterwards, use make to compile Atrinik:
  $ make

 If you have a multi-core CPU, you can specify the number of threads to start:
  $ make -j4

 If you only want a specific component, you can pass a target to make:
  $ make atrinik-server

 List of common make targets:
  - atrinik-server:  The Atrinik server
  - atrinik:         The Atrinik client
  - atrinik-toolkit: Toolkit library used by both the client and the server
  - test:            Run the unit tests
  - clean:           Remove the generated binaries

===============================
= 2.1 Prerequisites (Windows) =
===============================

 You will need to install the following programs/libraries:
 - MinGW
    The compiler that you will use for compiling. Download it here:
    http://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw/files/latest/download?source=files

    After installing, execute the mingw-install-prereq.bat script in "tools"
    directory (located in Atrinik root directory).
 - CMake
    Required to build makefiles. Download it here:

    http://www.cmake.org/files/v3.0/cmake-3.0.2-win32-x86.exe
 - Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributables 2008
    This is required for OpenSSL to work properly. Download it here:
    http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=29
 - OpenSSL
    Atrinik requires OpenSSL. Download it here:

    https://slproweb.com/products/Win32OpenSSL.html

    Make sure you get the full version for Windows 32-bit, and not the light
    version. For example, this one is OK:
    Win32 OpenSSL v1.0.2h

    The installer will ask where to copy OpenSSL DLL files. Make sure this is
    set to the system directory.
 - cURL
    Atrinik requires cURL. Download it here:

    https://curl.haxx.se/gknw.net/

    Get the latest version for 32-bit MinGW, eg:
    http://curl.haxx.se/gknw.net/7.40.0/dist-w32/curl-7.40.0-devel-mingw32.zip

    Extract the archive and copy "lib" and "include" directories into
    C:/MinGW (or where you installed MinGW).
 - Check (optional)
    This is only needed if you want to do development and is used to run unit
    tests. Download it here:

    http://sourceforge.net/projects/check/files/latest/download

    Extract to C:/MinGW/msys/1.0/home/<your username> and open bash through the
    Windows run dialog in start menu (C:\MinGW\msys\1.0\bin\bash.exe). In the
    extracted directory run the following (adjust the prefix if necessary):

    export PATH=/usr/bin:$PATH
    export CFLAGS="-DPTW32_STATIC_LIB"
    ./configure --prefix=/c/MinGW
    make && make check && make install

 In addition, the server needs the following programs/libraries:
 - GD Graphics Library (optional, recommended):
    If you want to generate client maps you will need to install this library.

    Download libpng sources from here:
    http://sourceforge.net/projects/libpng/files/libpng16/1.6.14/libpng-1.6.14.tar.gz/download

    Extract to C:/MinGW/msys/1.0/home/<your username> and open bash through the
    Windows run dialog in start menu (C:\MinGW\msys\1.0\bin\bash.exe). In the
    extracted directory run the following (adjust the prefix if necessary):

    export PATH=/usr/bin:$PATH
    ./configure --prefix=/c/MinGW
    make && make install

    Download GD sources from here:
    https://bitbucket.org/libgd/gd-libgd/downloads/libgd-2.1.0.tar.gz

    Extract to C:/MinGW/msys/1.0/home/<your username> and open bash through the
    Windows run dialog in start menu (C:\MinGW\msys\1.0\bin\bash.exe). In the
    extracted directory run the following (adjust the prefix if necessary):

    export PATH=/usr/bin:$PATH
    ./configure --prefix=/c/MinGW --with-png=/c/MinGW
    make && make install
 - Python
    Download and install the latest Python 3 from here:

    https://www.python.org/downloads/

    For example this one:
    https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.4.2/python-3.4.2.msi

 In addition, the client needs the following programs/libraries:
 - SDL
    Atrinik requires SDL, SDL_image and SDL_ttf. SDL_mixer is also necessary to
    play music and sounds. Either compile these yourself, or download
    pre-compiled libraries and binaries here:

    https://www.atrinik.org/download/win32/libsdl-all.zip

    Extract the archive and copy "lib" and "include" directories into
    C:/MinGW (or where you installed MinGW). Then copy the contents of the "bin"
    directory to the client's directory.
 - Timidity
    You need to install Timidity GUS patches in order to play MIDI files
    correctly. Download them here:

    http://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_mixer/timidity/timidity.tar.gz

    Extract the archive and copy "timidity" directory into the client's
    directory.

    You will also need to download this Timidity config file and put it into
    the client directory:

    https://www.atrinik.org/download/win32/timidity.cfg

 Make sure you have the following paths in your PATH environment variable, in
 this order (adjust accordingly if you installed MinGW or CMake somewhere else):

 C:\MinGW\bin;C:/MinGW/msys/1.0/bin;C:\Program Files (x86)\CMake\bin

 Install Netbeans for C/C++. Download it here:

 https://netbeans.org/downloads/start.html?platform=windows&lang=en&option=cpp

=============================
= 2.2 Compilation (Windows) =
=============================

 Once you have installed all the prerequisites, launch Netbeans, then go to
 Tools -> Options -> C/C++ -> Build Tools and click the Add button. Enter
 C:\MinGW\bin (or where you installed MinGW) into the "base directory" box.

 Go to File -> New Project -> C/C++ Project with Existing Sources and select
 the Atrinik directory (i.e., the directory this file is located in). Click
 "Finish" and the project should build automatically.

============================================
= 2.3 Building Atrinik installer (Windows) =
============================================

 If you're creating a release build, you will need to specify CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE
 to "Release". You can do so by editing (or creating) the file build.user in
 the root Atrinik directory and adding the following at the end:

 set(CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE "Release")

 Alternatively, you can create a debug build (by default). In this case, the
 generated exe will contain a large number of debug symbols, which can be split
 into a separate file by using the following command in a Bash shell:

 ../tools/split_symbols.sh atrinik.exe

 You will need to place tar.exe and gunzip.exe binaries to the client's
 directory. You can download them here (or compile them yourself):

 http://www2.cs.uidaho.edu/~jeffery/win32/

 Then download latest ca-bundle.crt and place it in the client's directory:

 https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bagder/ca-bundle/master/ca-bundle.crt

 Go to C:\OpenSSL-Win32 (or where you installed OpenSSL) and copy libeay32.dll
 and ssleay32.dll to the client's directory.

 Then run the following in the client's directory to build an installer:

 cpack -G NSIS
