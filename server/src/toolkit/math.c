/**
 * A Linked-List Memory Sort
 * by Philip J. Erdelsky <pje@efgh.com>
 * http://www.alumni.caltech.edu/~pje/
 * (Public Domain)
 *
 * The function sort_linked_list() will sort virtually any kind of singly-linked
 * list, using a comparison function supplied by the calling program. It has
 * several advantages over qsort().
 *
 * The function sorts only singly linked lists. If a list is doubly linked, the
 * backward pointers can be restored after the sort by a few lines of code.
 *
 * Each element of a linked list to be sorted must contain, as its first
 * members, one or more pointers. One of the pointers, which must be in the same
 * relative position in each element, is a pointer to the next element. This
 * pointer is <end_marker> (usually NULL) in the last element.
 *
 * The index is the position of this pointer in each element. It is 0 for the
 * first pointer, 1 for the second pointer, etc.
 *
 * Let n = compare(p, q, pointer) be a comparison function that compares two
 * elements p and q as follows:
 *
 * void *pointer; user-defined pointer passed to compare() by sort_linked_list()
 * int n;         result of comparing *p and *q
 *                     >0 if *p is to be after *q in sorted order
 *                     <0 if *p is to be before *q in sorted order
 *                      0 if the order of *p and *q is irrelevant
 *
 *
 * The fourth argument (pointer) is passed to compare() without change. It can
 * be an invaluable feature if two or more comparison methods share a
 * substantial amount of code and differ only in one or more parameter values.
 *
 * The last argument (pcount) is of type (unsigned long *). If it is not NULL,
 * then *pcount is set equal to the number of records in the list.
 *
 * It is permissible to sort an empty list. If first == end_marker, the returned
 * value will also be end_marker.
