type SHOP_FLOOR
field object::randomitems
If not NULL, will be the goods to generate on map load.
field FLAG_AUTO_APPLY
If set, will generate goods from object::randomitems on map load.
field FLAG_CURSED
If set, randomly generated goods will not be clone items.
field living::exp
Quality level of randomly generated goods, if 0, will use map's difficulty.
field FLAG_DAMNED
If set, generated goods will never become artifacts.
field FLAG_IS_MAGICAL
If set, the shop floor will be a unique shop; items dropped will stay there until someone buys them or the map resets.
end

type SYMPTOM
field object::stats
Modify stats
field living::hp
Modify regen
field object::value
Progression counter (multiplier = value / 100)
field living::food
Modify food use (from object::last_eat in @ref DISEASE)
field living::maxsp
Suck mana (as noted for @ref DISEASE)
field object::last_sp
Lethargy
field object::msg
What to say
field object::speed
Speed of movement, from @ref DISEASE
end

type GATE
field living::hp
How long a gate is open/closed.
field living::maxhp
Initial value for living::hp.
field living::sp
If zero the gate is closed, if 1 the gate is open.
end

type CREATOR
field connected
What connection number will trigger the creator.
field living::hp
How many times it may create before stopping.
field FLAG_LIFESAVE
If set, it'll never disappear but will go on creating everytime it's triggered.
field object::other_arch
The object to create on top of the creator.
end

type DETECTOR
field object::slaying
Name of the thing the detector is to look for.
field object::speed
Frequency of 'glances'.
field connected
Connected value of detector.
field living::sp
1 if detection sets buttons, -1 if detection unsets buttons.
end

type MARKER
field living::hp
How many times the marker will work. If zero, infinite, otherwise every time the marker grants a mark, the value is decremented and when reached zero, the marker is removed.
end

type DISEASE
field object::attack
Attack type(s) of the disease, for example, attack_godpower 100.
field object::other_arch
Object created and dropped when symptom moves.
field object::title
When the "disease" infects something, it will print "title victim!!!" to the player who owns the "disease".
field living::wc
field_help DISEASE_LDUR
The chance of someone in range catching the disease, divided by 127.
field object::magic
field_help DISEASE_LDUR
The range at which infection may occur. If negative, the range is NOT level dependent.
field object::stats
field_help DISEASE_ADVERSE
What stats are reduced by the disease (str, con, ...)
field living::maxhp
field_help DISEASE_LDUR
How long the disease will persist if the host dies and "drops" it, in "disease moves", i.e., moves of the disease. If negative, permanent.
field object::value
The counter for maxhp, it starts at maxhp and drops...
field living::dam
field_help DISEASE_LDAM
How much damage it does. If positive, it is straight damage. If negative, a percentage.
field living::maxgrace
field_help DISEASE_LDUR
How long in "disease moves" the disease lasts in the host, if negative, permanent until cured.
field living::food
If negative, disease is permanent. Otherwise, decreases at &lt;speed&gt;, disease goes away at food = 0, set to "maxgrace" on infection.
field object::speed
The speed of the disease, how fast "disease moves" occur.
field object::last_sp
field_help DISEASE_LDAM
The lethargy imposed on the player by the disease. A lethargy of "1" reduces the players speed to 1% of its normal value.
field living::maxsp
field_help DISEASE_LDAM
How much mana is sapped per "disease move". If negative, a percentage is taken.
field living::ac
field_help DISEASE_LDAM
Every "disease move" the severity of the symptoms are increased by ac / 100. (severity = 1 + (accumlated_progression) / 100)
field object::last_eat
field_help DISEASE_ADVERSE_LDAM
Increases food usage if negative.
field object::last_heal
If nonzero, disease does NOT grant immunity when it runs out.
field living::exp
Experience awarded when plague cured.
field living::hp
field_help DISEASE_ADVERSE_LDAM
Reduces regeneration of disease-bearer.
field living::sp
field_help DISEASE_ADVERSE_LDAM
Reduces spellpoint regeneration.
field object::name

field object::msg
What the plague says when it strikes.
field object::race
Species/race the plague strikes (* = everything).
field object::level
General description of the plague's deadliness
field living::wc
Reduction in wc per generation of disease. This builds in a self-limiting factor.
end

type PLAYER_MOVER
field object::direction
Direction the activating object will be moved to, if zero, a random one will be chosen. Perhaps useful for a dance club.
field object::speed
How often it will move objects.
field FLAG_LIFESAVE
If set, it'll disappear after living::hp + 1 moves.
field living::maxsp, living::sp
If both are set, it'll paralyze the victim for living::maxsp * his speed / object::speed
end
