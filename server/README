=======================================
=           Atrinik Server            =
=======================================

Website: http://www.atrinik.org/

Server package for the Atrinik game.

================================================
= 1. Compiling the Atrinik server              =
================================================

See the INSTALL file for instructions on how to compile the server.

================================================
= 2. Running the server                        =
================================================

In order to start up the server, you will need to run the resource collection
script, which can be located - from the root of the repository - here:
    ./tools/collect.py

The above script will collect various resources from the 'arch' directory and
will compile the NPC interfaces definitions into executables, and should be
ran from the tools directory. You should see output like:
    $ ./collect.py 
    Starting resource collection...
    Collecting factions...
    Collecting treasures...
    Collecting animations...
    Collecting archetypes...
    Collecting artifacts...
    Collecting images...
    Collecting interfaces...
    Done!

You can use the -d option to specify the root directory of your Atrinik
package, instead of running it from the tools directory, like so:
    $ ./tools/collect.py -d ~/atrinik

The script should be executed every time you update the repository or make
manual changes to archetypes/artifacts/images/interfaces/etc.

Afterwards, you can start up the server with ./server.sh or ./server.bat
(depending on your platform). Starting up the server using the binary is
also possible, but generally not recommended, as the startup scripts take
care of various aspects, such as first-time installation.

For example, you should see something like this:
    $ ./server.sh 
    [15:04:46.112927] INFO   [main:634] Server ready. Waiting for
    connections...

The startup scripts will also pass any extra options straight to the
binary, for example:
    $ ./server.sh --version
    [15:07:12.638483] INFO   [version:94] This is Atrinik v4.0 (master/7fc333e
    by Alex Tokar)

However, if you want to do it yourself, you will need to do the
following (working from the server directory):
 - Create 'lib' directory if it doesn't exist
 - If the 'data' directory doesn't exist, copy 'install_data' as 'data'
   and create a 'data/tmp' directory
 - Copy all files (not directories) from ../arch to the 'lib' directory;
   this will need to be done every time you run the collect.py script.
   Alternatively, you can run the collect script like this to automatically
   copy the necessary files:
   $ ./collect.py -o ../server/lib
 - Now you can launch the atrinik-server binary manually.

It is recommended to generate the region maps prior to starting up the server.
As this can take some time, they are not generated automatically, but you need
to use the --worldmaker switch, eg, run this prior to starting up your server:
    $ ./server.sh --worldmaker

The region maps are not mandatory to play the game, however, some features may
not work (specifically, the client will only be able to work with dynamic area
maps and not the full region maps).

Starting up the server will also start an HTTP server for serving the game data
files. If you like, you can use any HTTP server of your choice instead, as long
as it's properly configured. See section 2.2. for details.

================================================
= 2.1. Configuring the server                  =
================================================

The server has a number of configuration options, optimized for local server
play. However, if you feel like tweaking them, you will need to change the
configuration file server.cfg, or create a new file called server-custom.cfg
and put your custom settings there (this is the preferred way, especially when
working from a Git repository).

You can examine the server.cfg file to learn about most of the default settings
and what they do. Additionally, you can use the -h or --help option when
executing the server to learn about all the possible options (there is a 1:1
mapping between the configuration files and arguments passed on the command line,
so you can use the same options either way; eg, "port = 900" in a configuration
file and ./atrinik-server --port=900 are the same thing).

See section 3. for information about running a public server and the necessary
configuration, and section 4. for enabling crypto extensions.

================================================
= 2.2. Running your own HTTP server            =
================================================

You can disable the bundled HTTP server with this configuration option:
    http_server = off

In this case, you will need to configure an HTTP server of your own, which
will serve the necessary server files. Also, if you plan on using a different
URL/port for the server files, you will have to change this configuration to
suit your needs:
    http_url = http://localhost:8080

You will need to map the following URLs to their directory counterparts:
 - http://localhost:8080/                     -> server/data/http/
 - http://localhost:8080/resources            -> server/resources/

================================================
= 3. Running a public server                   =
================================================

!!!
!!! WARNING:
!!! READ ALL OF THIS CAREFULLY. FAILURE TO DO SO
!!! MAY LOCK YOU OUT OF METASERVER ACCESS.
!!!

There are several security considerations for running your own server. First
off, note that with default configuration, any player character is by default
in development mode. You will want to disable this with the following
configuration:
    default_permission_groups = None

Second, by default, the server listens on both IPv4 and IPv6 loopback
interfaces (if present). It is generally recommended to disable the network
stacks you don't need, or if you want to support both IPv4/IPv6 and you have
a system with dual-stack network support, you may enable the configuration for
that instead. Some examples:
 - IPv4-only:
    network_stack = ipv4=127.0.0.1
 - IPv6-only:
    network_stack = ipv6=::1
 - Dual-stack:
    network_stack = dual

Third, it's STRONGLY recommended to enable the crypto extensions for secure
password exchange and in-game communications, on top of establishing server
trust and authenticity. See section 4. for details.

The HTTP URL will need to be changed, otherwise outside clients will not be
able to download the necessary data files. You will need to use either an IP
address or a hostname (preferable), and you will need to have the specified
port open, for example:
    http_url = http://www.example.com:8080

In order to advertise the server to the public, you will need to configure
metaserver options. This will enable periodic flooding of your server details
to the Atrinik metaserver (found at: https://meta.atrinik.org). See section
3.1. for details about the sort of information this exposes. The necessary
options are:
    server_name = Your Server Name
    server_host = www.example.com
    server_desc = Description about your server.

Adjust the above as necessary. The hostname MUST resolve to the IP address
of the server. It's strongly discouraged to use PTR records, as they are used
for a different purpose. If you don't have a static IP, dynamic DNS services
or low-TTL DNS records are encouraged.

Do note that for security reasons, the metaserver will block IP changes for
up to an hour, so public servers with dynamic IPs are not encouraged due to
the possible outage period.

Make sure the Atrinik port (1728 by default, can be changed with port=xyz) is
accessible from the outside (ie, set up your firewall accordingly). See section
3.2. for detail about the various ports.

After you have all of the above set up, the next time you launch the server,
it should connect to the metaserver and update it with your server information,
allowing players with a compatible client to connect.

Be aware that the first time the server uploads the information to the
metaserver, a secret key is generated. If you LOSE this key, you will be LOCKED
out of updating the metaserver ever again (for the particular hostname). The
key can be found in server/data/metaserver_key, once generated.

================================================
= 3.1. Metaserver-exposed information          =
================================================

Apart from the obvious identifying information exposed by any IP connection
(such as the server IP address), the following information is exposed to the
metaserver, and flooded in periodic intervals, if reporting to the metaserver
has been enabled (as per section 3.):
 - Configured server name, hostname and description
 - Enabled game data ports (normal/crypto)
 - Server version
 - Atrinik HTTP client version and platform (Windows/Linux/other)
 - Generated metaserver key (for authentication purposes)
 - Number of players online
 - List of online players (apart from hidden ones)
 - ADS-7 compatible Atrinik server certificate, if configured
 - RSA public key, if configured

The above information is sent to https://meta.atrinik.org/ (unless otherwise
specified), again, only if enabled as per section 3. Application-based HPKP is
used to pin the signature of the outermost leaf certificate for security
reasons. The ultimate-trust keys can be found in server/data/keys.

================================================
= 3.2. Ports used by Atrinik                   =
================================================

The following ports are used by the Atrinik server and need to be opened in
order for other players to connect successfully (they can all be changed in
the configuration).

 - 1728: The main game data port
 - 1729: The security extension port; clients will connect to this port
         instead of the one above if the security extensions are enabled.
 - 8080: The HTTP server port; used by clients to download large game data
         files

================================================
= 4. Enabling crypto extensions                =
================================================

Protecting player data and ensuring communication privacy is a crucial aspect
of Atrinik. With the crypto extensions enabled, all text input commands and
communications are encrypted using ECDHE-RSA. These keys are ephemeral; created
for every new connection and destroyed on disconnect.

An X509 certificate is used to validate the server's identity. It is strongly
recommended to use a trusted CA; self-signed certificates are frowned upon and
will generate a one-time warning when connecting to a server using one.

See section 4.1. for generating an X509 certificate, and an RSA private key
for it.

Do NOT lose your RSA private key; the client deploys a public-key pinning
technology which means if it ever sees your server using a different key, it
will raise red flags and show a warning to the player before they can connect.

You can enable the security extensions like this:
    [crypto]
    crypto = true
    crypto_cert = </path/to/cert.pem
    crypto_cert_key = </path/to/key.pem

The cert.pem file should contain your X509 certificate, while the key.pem file
should countain your RSA private key that was used to sign the certificate.
Note that if you protected the private key with a passphrase, you will need to
enter it every time you start up the server.

If you need to specify a certificate chain file (eg, one provided by a CA of
your choice), you can do so like this:
    [crypto]
    crypto_cert_chain = </path/to/chain.pem

It is recommended to disable the regular port when using the crypto extensions,
unless you need to support clients without crypto extensions support:
    [general]
    port = 0

By default, the port used by the crypto extensions is 1729. You can change it
like this:
    [crypto]
    port_crypto = 1729

If you've set up everything correctly, the server should now be reporting its
public key to the metaserver, and advertising crypto extension capabilities,
which means that clients should be connecting via a secure channel.

However, this is not the end of it; so far, all you have established is a
secure channel between the server and its clients. While all the different
security checks put in place should stop a rogue server takeover or a MITM
attack, they require a client to connect at least once before any such
attack (to pin the public key), and they do not completely thwart DNS
spoofing attacks.

Please see section 4.2. for the absolute way of establishing server trust
and authenticity.

================================================
= 4.1. Generating an X509 certificate          =
================================================

You can create a self-signed X509 certificate using a command like this:
    $ openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:4096 -keyout key.pem -out cert.pem -days X

Add -nodes if you don't want a passphrase for the RSA key (otherwise you will
be prompted for it each time the server starts up), and change X to the number
of days you want the certificate to remain valid for. Use the server's hostname
for the CN.

Keep the generated RSA key secure and backed up; if you lose access to it and
generate an X509 certificate using a different one in the future, clients that
previously connected to your server will first have to go through a warning
sign due to public key pinning.

The preferred alternative is to go through the process of generating an X509
certificate signing request and getting the X509 certificate from a CA. Let's
Encrypt provides a free service for trusted certificates, although they have a
short expire time, and there's some manual work involved in making them use
your own RSA key for the signing part. At any rate, the process is outside of
the scope of this document; the only requirement is that the CN must match that
of your configured server hostname.

================================================
= 4.2. Server vetting                          =
================================================

Server vetting is a process by which an Atrinik team member examines a
server and confirms its identity, generating a signature that clients can
verify to establish the server is who they claim to be.

At its core is a specially designed certificate format (the design
specification of which can be found in ADS-7). This certificate is something
that the server owner must fill out and send to the Atrinik team for review;
either via email to admin@atrinik.org, a post on the forums (www.atrinik.org)
or a direct PM to one of the team members.

The certificate looks like this:
========================== BEGIN ATRINIK CERTIFICATE ==========================

The purpose of this certificate is to establish authenticity of the
below-described Atrinik server.

This certificate comes with a SHA512 hash of the certificate's contents,
signed with one of the ultimate trust Atrinik keys, and MUST be considered
void if it can't be verified using one of those keys.

==========================     BEGIN INFORMATION     ==========================
Name:                                                          Your Server name

Port:                                                                      1728

IPv6 address:                                                               ::1

Public key:    swIDAQAB
Public key:    -----END PUBLIC KEY-----
==========================      END INFORMATION      ==========================

The above information MUST be validated whenever establishing a connection
to the Atrinik server.

==========================  END ATRINIK CERTIFICATE  ==========================

The name, hostname and ports must match that of your server configuration. The
public key is that of the RSA key you used to sign your X509 certificate.

Now, the IPv4 andIPv6 addresses are optional. It is understood that there may
be servers with dynamic IPs, and renewing the certificate for such servers may
not be viable. However, a certificate with no IP addresses specified will have
a weaker security rating in the client, and it's strongly recommended to use
static IP addresses anyway.

If you do specify the IP addresses, and you only have an IPv4 address, you must
include the IPv6 address line as well, but leave it blank. The same applies
vice-versa.

Once you have a certificate like the one above, save it to a file (refer to it
as server-cert.txt from now on) and send a copy to the Atrinik team, who will
produce a signature, after the confirmation process (during which you may be
contacted for more information). Save this signature to another file (refer to
it as server-cert-sig.txt from now on), and adjust your configuration like so:
    [crypto]
    server_cert = </path/to/server-cert.txt
    server_cert_sig = </path/to/servert-cert-sig.txt

After (re-)starting the server, it should update the metaserver with the
certificate contents and its signature, and your clients should be protected
with the highest level of security available at this time.
