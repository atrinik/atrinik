To install and compile the Daimonin client you need 3 SDL libraries.

The used libraries are "SDL", "SDL_mixer" and "SDL_image".

First, read the README.txt file inside your target OS. For some OS we have precompiled
library files zipped inside the folders. Follow the directions to compile for your 
specific OS. The win32 or the linux installation is a good start.

If you want/need to make a installation for perhaps a new OS, you need to get the
for this OS compiled SDL libraries.

Then you need the compiled SDL lib files for your specific OS.
You can go the homepage of SDL:

http://www.libsdl.org/index.php

There you will find any needed information about your OS.

Or, you can download the source packages of the SDL libraries from the Daimonin
homepage or from CVS. You have to COMPILE these packages first! So be warnend.
