This script can be used to easily build a map maker package. It will automatically
package the whole map maker, but you have to build the server/client binaries
first.

=== Running the script ===

To run the script, you need to specify your working copy directory and your Atrinik
repository copy directory.

Repository copy directory will be used to copy default files, so you should run this
when the repository is not modified and is up-to-date.

Working copy directory will be the place where you built the binaries for the server
and the client.

Example of running the script:
  ./build.py -r ~/atrinik -w ~/atrinik-working

=== Instructions ===

You have to build the binaries before running the script. The list of binaries the
script needs can be found below. All the binaries should be 32-bit so they can be
ran on 64-bit systems as well.

server/atrinik-server:
  GNU/Linux binary of the server.

server/atrinik-server.exe:
  Windows binary of the server.

server/*.dll:
  DLLs needed by the Windows server. This is optional as some builds of the server
  don't need any dlls.

server/plugins/*.so:
  GNU/Linux plugin binaries. There must be at least one plugin.

server/plugins/*.dll:
  Windows plugin binaries. There must be at least one plugin.

client/atrinik:
  GNU/Linux binary of the client.

client/atrinik.exe:
  Windows binary of the client.

client/*.dll:
  DLLs needed by the Windows client. Required.

=== Merge ===

Everything located inside the 'merge' directory in the directory this file is in will
be merged into the map maker package.
