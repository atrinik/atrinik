help object_id
title Object ID
msg
When a help page mentions [b]object_id[/b] in syntax parameters, it means you have to specify object name (often without spaces) or its ID (which can be found by using examine on the object, near the top saying 'count xxxxx': the xxxxx is the ID).

If you use the object's ID, you have to put a hash symbol in front of it, for example:

/patch #86301 no_pick 1

It's easier to use the object's name, but many objects have spaces in the names, and many commands (like /patch above) don't allow you to include spaces in the object's name:

/patch guard friendly 0
/remove skeleton mage

The IDs/names will first be checked against the online players (not in their inventories though), then below you (including inventories), and at last on the whole map the DM is standing on (including inventories).

help music player
title Music Player Widget
msg
You can use the music player to play your favorite tunes from the game, or play them all one-by-one in random order (shuffle).

Note that if you use the music player, in-game areas won't change your music until you click [b]Stop[/b].

The [b]Currently playing[/b] field will show you name of the current music file being played, either by the music player or in-game area.

[title]Controls[/title]

Use mouse wheel or drag the slider to scroll the list of music files. To play a music file, either double-click it, or select it by left-clicking it once and click on [b]Play[/b]. The selected music file will loop infinitely, or until the [b]Stop[/b] button is pressed (which replaces the [b]Play[/b] button if the music player is playing something).

Click the [b]Shuffle[/b] button to play music files at random. When one songs ends in the shuffle mode, no looping is done, but instead next one is chosen at random.

In order to stop all background music for the current client session, you can double-click [b]Disable music[/b] at the end of the music list.

If you stop the music player and you want the in-game area music to return, you will have to re-enter the area.

[title]Playlist[/title]

You can construct your own playlist using the music player by [b]blacklisting[/b] songs you don't want on the playlist. In order to blacklist a song, select it in the music list and press the [b]-[/b] button. Blacklisted entries will appear in red color on the music list, and will never play in the shuffle mode. You can remove a song from the blacklist by selecting it and clicking the [b]+[/b] button (which will appear instead of the [b]-[/b] one).

In order to mass-change blacklist status of all the songs, select a song, and hold down the [b]-[/b]/[b]+[/b] button (depending on whether you want to blacklist the song or remove it from the blacklist, respectively).

If you know the selected spell, you will be able to see the mana/grace cost below the description, near the bottom. You will also see the spell's icon, and path [b]Status[/b]. Usually, this will be [b]Normal[/b], but if you apply an object that is attuned to a certain path, or repelled/denied from it, you will see that in the [b]Status[/b].

[title]Controls[/title]

Use mouse wheel or drag the slider to scroll the list of spells (if applicable). Switch between spell paths by clicking the [b]&lt;[/b] and [b]&gt;[/b] buttons below the list of spells. If you keep holding those buttons, the spell paths will continue changing. The last spell path will show you all the spells, from all spell paths.

In order to ready a spell, double-click its name in the spells list. You can also drag the currently selected spell's icon in the bottom right corner, and drop it into your quickslots for fast access.

You can filter the list of spells using the buttons above the currently selected spell's description. If you press [b]Known[/b], only spells that you know will be shown - otherwise, both known and unknown are shown. The [b]&lt;[/b] and [b]&gt;[/b] buttons allow you to switch between types of spells shown: wizardry [b]spells[/b], divine [b]prayers[/b], or [b]all[/b].

The [b]F9[/b] key (default) can be used to open/close the widget.

title Party List Widget
msg
The party widget allows you to form and join parties. While in a party, you can chat with fellow members of the party using the <a=help:gsay>/gsay</a> command. In addition, you will automatically share gained experience with your party members, but only if they are nearby.

[title]Controls[/title]

In order to join a party, double-click the party name in the list. If no party is available, you will have to form a party yourself; this can be done by pressing the [b]Form[/b] button, and entering the new party name in the text input that pops up.

After joining/forming a party, the list will switch to show you the party members, including their HP, mana and grace bars. You can switch back to the list of parties using the [b]Parties[/b] button, and back to members using [b]Members[/b] button.

If you are currently a member of a party, additional buttons will be available, including the [b]Leave[/b] button, using which you can leave the party at any time. There is also a [b]Password[/b] button, with which you can change the party password, but only if you are the party leader. The [b]Chat[/b] button will pop up the regular text input, with <a=help:gsay>/gsay</a> prefixed, so you can immediately type in your party chat message.

help region map
title Region Map
msg
The region map shows you a map of the current region you are located on, for example, Strakewood Island. This is handy to find new places of interest, quest locations, etc.

If you hover the mouse over buildings and some other locations, you will see a tooltip with the area description, which is useful for getting around in large cities.

[title]Controls[/title]

The [b]R[/b] key (default) may be used to bring up the region map - alternatively you can click its icon (a map piece) in the buttons panel at top right.

In order to scroll the map, hold down the left mouse button over the visible map - the closer you are to the center of the visible map, the slower it will scroll. You can also use the arrow keys to scroll the map, and hold down shift in order to scroll faster with the arrow keys.

Zooming the map can be done using [b]Page Up[/b] key to zoom the map in, or [b]Page Down[/b] key to zoom it out. Using the mouse wheel is also possible.

Inside this popup, you can change various settings - for example, your keybindings (macros), your character's password (if you're currently in-game), or client-related settings.

When you open this popup, you will see <a=help:client settings>Client Settings</a> and <a=help:keybinding settings>Key Settings</a>. If you are currently in-game, you will also see [b]Logout[/b] (which logs you out of the game) and [b]Back to Play[/b] (which closes the popup). Also if you're in-game, you will see a <a=help:password change>Password</a> button on the top left.

[title]Controls[/title]

The controls are very straightforward - either use the arrow keys to scroll through the available options and press enter on the one you select, or click the one you want using the mouse.
endmsg

help client settings
title Client Settings
msg
Allows you to change client-related settings. The [b]&lt;[/b] and [b]&gt;[/b] buttons above the list can be used to change the settings category.

[title]Controls[/title]

Regular list controls apply - such as using the mouse wheel or dragging the slider to scroll, up and down arrow keys to move, etc.

Left and right arrow keys can be used instead of [b]&lt;[/b] and [b]&gt;[/b] setting buttons. If you hold down shift, the settings category buttons will be affected instead.

Clicking [b]Apply[/b] button will immediately apply the new settings - which is useful if you are checking out the different resolutions, for example. The [b]Done[/b] button will do the same as [b]Apply[/b], but will also exit the popup.
endmsg
end

help keybinding settings
title Key Settings
msg
Allows you to change keybindings (macros).

Whenever you press a key, the keybindings are checked for a matching key. This process is first done for keys with keyboard modifiers, and after that, for keys without any keyboard modifiers, which will also work even if the current keyboard modifier state does not match. This is done so, for example, firing still works when you hold the [b]CTRL[/b] key (default) and a direction key - otherwise, the keybindings would only match on CTRL+direction keybindings. Keys with keyboard modifiers are done first so that it is possible to override this behavior with your own keybindings.

[title]Controls[/title]

In order to change a keybinding, you double-click it in the list of keybindings (or press enter on the selected one). The editing text inputs appear, and the command text input will be focused. When you are done changing it (if applicable), press enter and the focus will switch to the keyboard shortcut, and you will be prompted to press the key combination for the keybinding. You can use modifiers such as shift, ctrl, alt, etc. After entering the shortcut, press enter again and the change will be applied. If you do not want to change the shortcut, you can just click the [b]Apply[/b] button after you have entered the keybinding command.

The [b]Add[/b] button can be used to add a new keybinding - the process is the same as editing (explained above), but both text inputs do not have any input to edit (obviously).

[b]Remove[/b] button will remove the selected keybinding, and [b]Repeat[/b] button will turn the repeat flag on/off. If the repeat flag for a keybinding is on, the shortcut will repeat after a short delay while it's still being held down.

end

help main screen
title Main Screen
msg
The main screen contains the list of servers (on the left), and list of latest game news (on the right).

The list of servers allows you to choose the server to play on - the [b]Main Server[/b] is the recommended one to play on.

The list of latest game news keeps you updated about game updates on the [b]Main Server[/b]. You can read more about any of the updates in the list by double-clicking the name of the update in the list, or using enter after switching to the list (see further down for list controls).

[title]Controls[/title]

By default, the servers list is focused. Focus is a keyboard-only concept, which means that only the focused list will receive keyboard events, such as using the arrow keys to move in the list. If there is more than one active list on the screen, such as the main screen, you can use the [b]Tab[/b] key to cycle between them.

Lists use standard GUI behavior - that is, up and down arrow keys to scroll, page up/down to scroll several lines at once, enter to trigger an action, etc. The mouse may also be used to use the lists, such as dragging the list slider (if any) to scroll the list quickly, or using the mouse wheel. Clicking an entry in the list once will select it (which is otherwise accomplished with arrow keys), while double-click triggers an action (like enter).

The [b]Play[/b] button will connect you to the selected game server - same as using enter in the servers list. [b]Refresh[/b] will re-download the list of servers, if you want to see updated player counts, for example.

The [b]Settings[/b] button may be used to open the settings popup, which allows you to edit client and key settings.

The [b]Update[/b] button will check for client updates - if you see in the game news that there is a new client available, this is the button you want. After clicking it, a popup will open - please wait patiently until all the progress dots turn green, then follow the instructions.

The [b]Quit[/b] button will exit the client, but the [b]ESC[/b] key can also be used instead of that.

If there are no responses, that means the NPC has finished talking to you, and you can close the conversation using either the [b]X[/b] button, or the [b]Close[/b] button. Pressing [b]ESC[/b] is also an option.

If the NPC's message is too long, you will be able to scroll the message contents using the arrow keys, page up/down keys, or by using the scrollbar with the mouse.

[title]Movement[/title]
There are two choices for movement in Atrinik: keyboard and mouse. Mouse-based movement is easier to use, however, the keyboard is more accurate.

[b]Mouse:[/b]
Move the mouse over the map area, and you'll see the square below your mouse highlighted with green borders. If you click that area, your character will try to move there.

[b]Keyboard:[/b]
You can use the keyboard numpad to move around, for example, [b]3[/b] on the numpad would move your character one step east. You can hold down the numpad key to run in this manner in the direction specified by the numpad key you are holding down. If you want to stop running, simply release the key.

[title]Obstacles[/title]
There are many obstacles to walk around in the world, ranging from trees to rocks, walls, deep water, doors, gates and the like.

Doors can be opened by walking into them with your character and will stay open for a short amount of time. Note that some doors require keys to open.

Gates can usually be opened using levers, switches, buttons and the like. Some may even require a secret activation phrase to open - thus it is a good idea to explore around.

Interacting with objects is an often-used part of the game. The objects right below your feet appear in a screen near the middle bottom. You can select them using the mouse, or with the arrow keys. In order to interact with them, you apply them, either by middle-clicking them, or pressing [b]A[/b] key to interact with the selected object.

The outcome of your interaction depends on the object you applied - stairs, ropes, ladders, etc will allow you to move across areas. Levers may be used to open gates or secret passages, light sources such as torches or lamps can be lit, etc.

Pressing the [b]E[/b] key will examine the currently selected object, which may reveal more information about it.

While the inventory is open, your player doll is shown as well near the top left part of the screen, which shows the items you are wearing and/or wielding.

Various items can be interacted with, such as compasses, which will tell you the direction you are currently facing, or light sources such as torches, which can be lit inside your inventory, and then wielded with a second interaction. Armor can be worn, weapons can be wielded, magic devices such as wands can be readied for firing, etc.

[b]Keyboard:[/b]
Select an item in your inventory using the arrow keys. Now, if you press the [b]A[/b] key, you will apply the selected item, thus interacting with it. If the item is, for example, a piece of armor, you will put it on your character - or if you're already wearing it, you'll unwear it.

You can use the [b]E[/b] key to learn more about the selected item, if it's identified. The [b]M[/b] key will mark the selected item, which is used in some NPC dialogues, such as when you want to send an item using the post office. Ammunition can be readied for firing using the [b]F[/b] key.

[b]Mouse:[/b]
In order to interact with an item using the mouse, you can drag-and-drop the item from your inventory into the player doll. If the item is, for example, a piece of armor, you will put it on your character. In order to unwear/unwield an item, drag it from your player doll back into the inventory.

Marking an item can be done by pressing the middle mouse button on the item you want to mark, which is used in some NPC dialogues, such as when you want to send an item using the post office.

Food items can be eaten by interacting with them (applying them), either from your inventory, or below your feet. Beware of unidentified food however, as it can be poisonous.

Containers are also often used part of areas such as treasure vaults, buildings, homes, etc, such as chests, lockers, drawers, shelves, etc, and sometimes contain items of importance, loot, quest items, etc.

In order to open a container <a=help:basics_object_interaction>below your feet</a>, simply interact with it once, and it will open, revealing the items it holds, and giving you the ability to pick up items from it, or drop items from your inventory into it. Second interaction will close the container again.

Containers in your <a=help:basics_inventory_interaction>inventory</a> behave slighty differently. If you interact with them once, they will become [i]readied[/i], and any items you pick up will automatically go into the container, if the container can hold them. A second interaction will open it, and you can take out items it holds into your inventory, or drop items from your inventory into it. Note that while open, picked up items will still go into it. Third interaction will close the container.

You can only have one container open at any time (be it in your inventory, or below your feet).
