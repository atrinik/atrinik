# types.xml - This is the defintitions-file for all the different    #
# Atrinik object types and their attributes.                         #
#                                                                    #
# The server code of the Atrinik game is always changing and         #
# evlolving. From time to time, object-attributes change in purpose, #
# or new ones are created.                                           #
# Therefore, it is important that an Editor is flexible and          #
# easy to "upgrade" to handle such new features. That's why the      #
# AtrinikEditor reads the type-definitions from this xml file.       #
#                                                                    #
# If you encounter bugs, typos or missing entrys in the LATEST       #
# VERSION of this file - Don't hesitate to improve it, contact us    #
# and eventually send the improved file to us: <admin@atrinik.org>.  #
# We will put it into the "official version" of the AtrinikEditor    #
# and all fellow Atrinik-Map-Makers can benefit from your work!      #

<!-- The attributes of the default_type get added to all other types by
	 default. Every type can have an 'ignore' element however, which is
	 used to specify default attributes *not* to inherit. -->
<default_type>
	<attribute arch="name" editor="name" type="string">
		This is the name of the object, displayed to the player.
	</attribute>
	<attribute arch="title" editor="title" type="string">
		This is the object's title. Once an object is identified the
		title is attached to the name. Typical titles are "of Yordan",
		"of xray vision" etc.
	</attribute>
	<attribute arch="sub_type" editor="sub type" type="int">
		This important value is used to define "sub types" for objects of
		the same object type. Examples are weapons, which are all from
		type WEAPON but can be different sub types like slash, cleave,
		two-handed, polearms and so on. This value goes to the client
		too.

		Warning: Not all objects have a sub type and changing it without
		care can corrupt server AND/OR the clients. Normally this is not
		a subject to change outside arch definition.
	</attribute>
	<attribute arch="layer" editor="layer" type="int">
		This is the map layer the object will put in. The selected layer
		will affect where and how this object is shown on the client side.
		Layer 0 is reserved for sys_object type objects and will NEVER be
		shown on the client side. Layer 1 is for floor objects and layer 2
		for floor masks. Layer 3 and 4 are for items on the ground. Layer
		5 is for walls, layer 6 is reserved for players and layer 7 is
		for spell effects and high flying/visible objects like arrows.
	</attribute>
	<attribute arch="sub_layer" editor="sub layer" type="int">
		Extension of the layer attribute. If you have an object with "layer 2
		sub_layer 1" and an object with "layer 2", the former object will be
		rendered immediately following the latter object, thus allowing double
		floor masks, convincing bridges and the like to be created.
	</attribute>
	<attribute arch="face" editor="image" type="facename">
		The image name defines what image is displayed for this object
		in-game.
	</attribute>
	<attribute arch="animation" editor="animation" type="animname">
		The animation-name defines what animation is displayed for this
		object in-game. Note that a set animation will overrule the face.
	</attribute>
	<attribute arch="anim_speed" editor="anim speed" type="int">
		How fast to play this animation.
	</attribute>
	<attribute arch="is_animated" editor="is animated" type="bool">
		If set, the object is animated and animation is used.

		Note: Some special objects will use an animation NOT as animation
		but as frame list. Examples are buttons (which frames are changed
		by the object status of the button). IS_TURNABLE will enable
		direction turning for some object types. These flags are all
		system related. Be VERY careful when changing them.
	</attribute>
	<attribute arch="speed_left" editor="start speed" type="float">
		When an active object (with 'speed' being non-zero) is put on a
		map, this value is used as counter. Every 'tick', 'speed' (if
		negative, value is turned positive before) is added to this
		value - if it is bigger than 0 the object 'will do something' and
		this counter is decreased with -1.0.

		By default a normal object will be put on the map with start
		speed 0. It 'will do something' with the next coming 'tick'.
		Setting this value to -1.0 will put it on map but wait one full
		'lifetime' round until it does something.

		A 'fire object' should be put on map with start speed 0 - it
		should try to burn something in the moment it comes in the game.
		A bomb for example should be put with speed -1.0 on the map - it
		will stay then on map until the bomb becomes active - it
		explodes.

		The 'lifetime' round is determinated by speed. A speed of 1.0
		will give a 'lifetime' round of 1 tick - a speed of 0.01 100
		ticks.

		Special case: A negative speed value will add to start speed a
		random value between 0.0 to 0.9 . So, a speed of -0.1 with a
		start speed of -1.0 will result in speed 0.1 and start speed
		between -1.0 and -0.1. This is useful to let a row of same
		objects act in different tick ranges.
	</attribute>
	<attribute arch="nrof" editor="number" type="int">
		This value determines the number of objects in one stack (for
		example: 100 goldcoins =&gt; "number = 100"). You should set this
		at least to one, for any pickable object - otherwise it won't be
		mergeable into a stack.
	</attribute>
	<attribute arch="weight" editor="weight" type="int">
		This value defines the object's weight in gram (1000g is 1kg).
		Objects with zero weight are not pickable for players. Still, set
		the "non-pickable" flag for explicitly non-pickable objects.
	</attribute>
	<attribute arch="value" editor="value" type="int">
		Change an object's value.
	</attribute>
	<attribute arch="glow_radius" editor="glow radius" type="int">
		If &lt;glow radius&gt; is set to a value greater than zero, the
		object appears lit up on dark maps. &lt;glow radius&gt; can be a
		value between 0 and 4, the higher, the more light does the object
		emit.
	</attribute>
	<attribute arch="z" editor="height" type="int">
		Adjusts Y position of the object as it appears on the map.
	</attribute>
	<attribute arch="zoom" editor="zoom" type="int" min="-32768" max="32767">
		How much to zoom the object on the map.
	</attribute>
	<attribute arch="zoom_x" editor="horizontal zoom" type="int" min="-32768" max="32767">
		How much to horizontally zoom the object on the map.
	</attribute>
	<attribute arch="zoom_y" editor="vertical zoom" type="int" min="-32768" max="32767">
		How much to vertically zoom the object on the map.
	</attribute>
	<attribute arch="align" editor="align" type="int">
		X align of the object on the map.
	</attribute>
	<attribute arch="alpha" editor="alpha" type="int">
		Alpha value of the object.
	</attribute>
	<attribute arch="rotate" editor="rotate" type="int">
		Rotation value of the object in degrees.
	</attribute>
	<attribute arch="material_real" editor="material" type="list_material_real">
		The material defines the exact material of which the object
		consists. It is much more specific than &lt;material class&gt;,
		however only one material can be selected, not multiple.

		&lt;material&gt; is not required to be set, it can be left
		'undefined'.
	</attribute>
	<attribute arch="material" editor="material class" type="bitmask_material">
		This bitmask-value informs the player of which basic material(s)
		the object consists. Material class does also affect how likely
		the object can be destroyed by hazardous spell-effects, like
		firestorm.
	</attribute>
	<attribute arch="can_stack" editor="stackable" type="bool">
		If set, the item can be stacked. Careful, don't use on rings or
		other applyable items, it will lead to side effects.

		Missiles are designed to be used as stacks for example.
	</attribute>
	<attribute arch="no_pick" editor="non-pickable" type="bool">
		If set, the object cannot be picked up (neither by players nor
		monsters).
	</attribute>
	<attribute arch="player_only" editor="player only" type="bool">
		If set, only players can enter the tile the object with this flag
		is on.
	</attribute>
	<attribute arch="is_invisible" editor="invisible" type="bool">
		Generally makes the object invisible. Invisible objects will be
		shown if the player has "see invisible" (from an item). To hide
		objects totally from detection, use "sys_object".
	</attribute>
	<attribute arch="sys_object" editor="inv. system object" type="bool">
		Marks an object as system object. System objects are ALWAYS
		invisible and hidden from the players.

		System objects are put in layer 0.
	</attribute>
	<attribute arch="no_teleport" editor="no teleport" type="bool">
		Marks an object as no teleport object. A no teleport object can't
		be teleported by teleporter except if the object is inside the
		inventory of another object which can be teleported.
	</attribute>
	<attribute arch="blocksview" editor="block view" type="bool">
		If an item is set to block view, players (and monsters) cannot
		see beyond it unless they cross it or manage to stand on top of
		it.
	</attribute>
	<attribute arch="one_drop" editor="one drop" type="bool">
		If this flag is set for an item inside monster's quest_container
		with the quest being quest item type, the player will only be able
		to get this item once.
	</attribute>
	<attribute arch="identified" editor="identified" type="bool">
		If an item is identified, the player has full knowledge about it.
	</attribute>
	<attribute arch="reflect_spell" editor="reflect spells" type="bool">
		Object will reflect spells.
	</attribute>
	<attribute arch="reflect_missile" editor="reflect missiles" type="bool">
		Object will reflect missiles.
	</attribute>
	<attribute arch="is_magical" editor="magical" type="bool">
		If set, this object counts as "magical". Detect magic or identify
		will show this flag and the player will see a small blue M in the
		client's inventory part.
	</attribute>
	<attribute arch="cursed" editor="cursed" type="bool">
		The item is cursed. This object can't be removed when wielded or
		worn (without uncursing it). Remove curse will remove this flag.
	</attribute>
	<attribute arch="cursed_perm" editor="permanent cursed" type="bool">
		The item is permanently cursed. If this flag is set, applying or
		unapplying it will set "cursed 1" again. This flag can't be
		removed by remove curse.
	</attribute>
	<attribute arch="damned" editor="damned" type="bool">
		Stronger form of curse. Item can't be removed when wielded or
		worn. Remove damnation will remove this flag.
	</attribute>
	<attribute arch="damned_perm" editor="permanent damned" type="bool">
		The item is permanently damned. If this flag is set, applying or
		unapplying it will set "damned 1" again. This flag can't be
		removed by remove damnation.
	</attribute>
	<attribute arch="no_magic" editor="no spells" type="bool">
		If enabled, it is impossible for players to use spells on that
		spot.
	</attribute>
	<attribute arch="unpaid" editor="unpaid" type="bool">
		An &lt;unpaid&gt; item cannot be used unless the player carried
		it over a shop mat, paying the demanded price. Setting this flag
		makes sense only for items inside shops.
	</attribute>
	<attribute arch="draw_direction" editor="direction based drawing" type="bool">
		If enabled, the object will be shown depending on its direction
		and player's position. Usually used by wall decoration so the
		decoration doesn't appear from both sides of the wall.
	</attribute>
	<attribute arch="is_turnable" editor="is turnable" type="bool">
		System flag. Object can be turned into directions.
	</attribute>
	<attribute arch="direction" editor="direction" type="int">
		The object's direction.

		pass. This is used for example for ghosts who move through doors.
	</attribute>
	<attribute arch="can_roll" editor="moveable" type="bool">
		If set, the object is able to "roll", so it can be pushed around
		with the /push command. This setting is used for boulders and
		barrels. If you're setting this attribute, make sure to check
		"can move on" as well, in order to set relevant terrain types
		the object can be pushed to.

		Useful for puzzles and mazes.
	</attribute>
	<attribute arch="unique" editor="unique item" type="bool">

	<attribute arch="last_sp" editor="glow radius" type="int">
		If &lt;glow radius&gt; is set to a value not zero, the object
		appears lit up on dark maps. The higher the value, the more light
		does the object emit. The current reasonable max value is 9.

		If the value is 0, the light can't be lit and can't be applied.
		This is used for burned out lights like torches.

		Abilities are to be put in a monster's inventory. They grant
		monsters the knowledge to cast spells. Spells from abilities are
		usually magical in nature, thus adding magic to the spell damage
		they produce. If not marked as magical, the ability as natural
		effect can't be disenchanted or blocked by dispel magic.
		<br><br>
		A particularly nice feature of abilities is that they can hold
		two spells: One for short range and one for long range use.

		If you want to create "customized" spell casting monsters, you
		should use abilities (rather than spell books/wands or
		something). The long/short-range spell feature can make boss
		monsters more interesting and challenging.
		<br><br>
		You should keep in mind that magic abilities allow players to get
		better resistance. You can turn off the magic part to make the
		spells more dangerous. However, this really should not be
		necessary unless you work on very high level maps.
		<br><br>
		It is possible to create monsters that will heal other friends.
		To accomplish this, simply go to the monster's <b>Behave</b> tab,
		<b>behavior</b> select box and check <b>Find friends for friendly
		spells</b>. Then create an ability in the monster with <b>short range
		spell</b> set as minor (or greater) healing. If you want this monster
		to also heal itself when it takes damage and has a valid enemy, set
		<b>long range spell</b> to the same spell.

		direction. Setting force movement makes it seemingly impossible
		but there is still a trick: One player can push a second player
		past the mover, in opposite to the mover's direction! The more
		movers, the more players needed. Hence, don't make a treasure
		room that is surrounded by movers instead of solid walls/gates.
		<br><br>
		Btw, it does not make a difference putting movers above or
		below the floor. Moreover, movers that are set to be invisible
		cannot be discovered with the show_invisible spell.
		<br><br>
		Note that Movers and Directors are seperate objects, even though
		they look and act similar. Directors only do spells/missiles,
		while movers only do living creatures (depending on how it
		is set: monsters and players).

		Wielding a weapon, the object's stats will be directly inherited
		by the player, usually enhancing his fighting-abilities. Non
		magical weapons can be improved with scrolls.
	]]>
	</description>
	<attribute arch="sub_type" editor="weapon type" type="list_weapon_st">
		The &lt;weapon type&gt; characterizes the type of weapon. Each of
		these weapon types requires an according skill to be used. You
		should always set this correctly when creating new weapons for
		your maps.
	</attribute>
	<attribute arch="dam" editor="damage" type="int">
		The damage value is used as base value for how much damage the
		weapon does per hit. The actual damage involves more
		dependencies, like wielder's level and defender's level. Look at
		existing weapons to get a feel for the range of weapon damage values.
	</attribute>
	<attribute arch="slaying" editor="slaying race" type="string">
		Slaying means the weapon does triple (3x) damage to monsters of
		the specified race. If &lt;slaying race&gt; matches an arch name,
		only monsters of that archetype are hit with triple damage.
	</attribute>
	<attribute arch="weapon_speed" editor="weapon speed" type="float">
		The weapon speed determines how often the wielder can swing the
		weapon during a certain period of time. The lower the faster,
		&lt;weapon speed&gt; 1 is best (that is lighting fast). A typical
		average value is 8. Speed and damage should be kept in reasonable
		relation.
	</attribute>
	<attribute arch="wc" editor="weapon class" type="int">
		The weapon class value adds to the overall weapon class of the
		wielder's melee attacks. Weapon class improves the chance of
		hitting the opponent.
	</attribute>
	<attribute arch="magic" editor="magic bonus" type="int">
		For a weapon, magic bonus works just like weapon class, except that
		magic bonus can be improved by the gods or reduced by acid. Hence, it is
		less useful than direct weapon class value on a weapon.
	</attribute>
	<attribute arch="item_level" editor="required level" type="int">
		If &lt;required level&gt; is set to a value greater than zero,
		players cannot use the weapon unless they meet this level in the
		skill category specified by &lt;level required in&gt;.

		For example: &lt;required level&gt; = 15, &lt;level required in&gt;
		= physical means the player cannot use the weapon unless he is
		equal or greater level than 15 in the physical skill category.
	</attribute>
	<attribute arch="item_skill" editor="level required in" type="list_item_skill">
		This attribute specifies in which skill category the player must
		meet the &lt;required level&gt; in order to use the weapon.
		It is meaningless when &lt;required level&gt; is zero/unset.

		For example: &lt;required level&gt; = 15, &lt;level required in&gt;
		= physical means the player cannot use the weapon unless he is
		equal or greater level than 15 in the physical skill category.
	</attribute>
	<attribute arch="lifesave" editor="save life" type="bool">
		An item with this flag enabled will save the players life once:
		When the player is wearing this item and his health points reach
		zero, the item disappears, replenishing the player's health and
		bringing him to hise savebed.

		An item with &lt;save life&gt; should not have any decent
		additional bonuses!
	</attribute>
	<attribute arch="unique" editor="unique item" type="bool">
		Unique items exist only one time on a server. If the item is
		taken, lost or destroyed - it's gone for good.
	</attribute>
	<attribute arch="startequip" editor="god-given item" type="bool">
		A god-given item vanishes as soon as the player drops it to the
		ground.

	<![CDATA[
		Quest containers are containers to be inserted to monsters and can be used in
		different ways depending on type of the quest.

		<h2>One drop quest</h2>
		One drop quest is a quest which doesn't have a quest giver, but is only located
		inside a monster. This is used to create quest items that will only drop once for
		each player, like King Rhun's Cloak. Item to be dropped for the player is inserted
		inside the quest container. If the item has "one_drop 1" set, the player will never
		be able to find the item again a second time. This means it should be set for special
		drops like Rhun's Cloak, but not for keys.

		<h2>Kill quest</h2>
		This kind of quest requires the player to kill X monsters before the quest is
		completed. Nothing is inserted inside the quest container.

		<h2>Kill item quest</h2>
		This is similar to a one drop quest, but the quest has a quest giver, which requires
		the player to find the item that is being looked for. Typically, a monster will drop
		the object to be found. The object that is being looked for is inserted inside the
		quest container.
	]]>
	</description>
	<use>
	<![CDATA[
		A useful trick with quest containers is that you can put the containers into the
		inventory of a random creator. Since random creators are parsed when the monster
		spawns and not when the inventory drops, this is useful to create a quest where
		the player needs to kill 5 ghosts, but the ghosts have only 50% chance to get
		counted to the killed total, with the help of random creators. Another example
		is a quest where an item is being looked for that drops from a specific monster
		(or a bunch of monsters) but using random creators it has only 10% chance of
		being dropped.

		Beacons are objects which can be located by scripts using their

		gate that is on map2 with lever that is on map1, for example).
		<br><br>
		With beacons, however, you can. Make a lever that triggers a
		script on use, with the script looking for a specific beacon ID
		in the game (if you know the map path the beacon is on you should
		use ReadyMap() first to ensure the beacon's map is loaded in
		memory). The beacon would be inside an invisible lever on the map
		with the gate you want to trigger sharing the same connection
		values, and the script would just then trigger the invisible
		lever using something like:
