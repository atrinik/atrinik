#
# Herein lie the formulae for alchemical products.
#
# The code is designed so that any fancy combination
# of objects may be combined to comprise a formula. Because
# the code only requests that the 'names' (see def below)
# of cauldron ingredients match those listed in the formula
# you can use *anything* found in the game as a possible
# ingredient. Legal names include both obj->name and a
# title field, if it exists. Therefore, it *is* legal to use
# an artifact like "cloak of protection" as an ingredient.
#
# Definitions of fields:
#
#  "Object" This is the title of the formula. In
#	    conjunction with a value in "arch" these
#	    are used to lookup artifacts from the
#	    artifacts file (ie. <arch> of <title>).
#	    If you want to just create the arch w/o
#	    making it an artifact, designate the
#	    object field as "NONE".
#
#  "chance" is how likely a formula is to appear in
#	    an alchemical grimore. Chance of 0 indicates
#	    the formula never appears.
#
#  "arch"   indicates the possible archetype that may
# 	    be used to generate the item.
#
#  "ingred" is a comma delimited list of ingredients
#	    that are needed to create the item. Each
#	    alchemical formula *should* be unique! but
#	    note that this is not required. Values of
# 	    ingredients must be the object names. Prepend
#	    an integer value to denote the number of that
#	    ingredient ("1" is not needed for single
#	    ingredients). Note that the ordering of the
#	    ingredients is *not* important.
#
#  "yield"  is the theoretical possible maximum # of
#	    items the recipe can generate.
#           It is fundamentally useful for balancing
#	    reward/effort for these recipes.  One intention
#           is to enforce conservation of mass by means
#           of this #.
#
#  "trans"  defaults to '0' and is not explicitly needed.
#	    If you define it to any value (ie '1') then
#	    one of the ingredients will be used as the base
#	    arch for the product. Obviously, the ingredient
#	    so used *must* have the same archetype as the
#	    product so don't be a fool and leave out a
#	    common archetype ingredient!! See bolt of Dragon
#	    slaying for an example of a transmution formula.
#
#  "keycode"  A string, such as "fire".  In order for the alchemist
#           to execute this recipe, he must have a FORCE with a
#	    slaying field matching the keycode
#
# IMPORTANT NOTE ---->
#	    It is not enough to construct ad-hoc lists of
#	    ingredients to make a formula. Playbalance will
#	    be adversely effected if you make a formula for
#	    a powerfull artifact (potion of stat raising, for
#	    example) that is common, and/or easy to assemble
#	    the ingredients, and/or has few ingredients. Thus,
#	    here are some general guidelines for making formulae:
#
#		1) no fewer than 2 ingredients
#		2) at least one ingredient needs to be found
#		   in the dungeon, or is rarely appearing in shop.
#		3) more ingredients for more powerfull stuff.
#		4) more 'expensive' ingredients for more powerfull
#		   stuff. 'expensive' here means its harder to get,
#		   more costly to buy, rarer to find.
#		5) Run crossfire with the -m9 switch to check your formula -
#		   It does some sanity checking and price checking
