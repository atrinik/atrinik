Humans are the generalists of the races. 
They are fit for any trade, and usually pick up a skill from 
their parents in addition to what they've learned as apprentices
in their craft. Females have the same stats as males.

The name half-elf can be confusing because it is used for humans
with elvish blood in the 2nd or 3rd generation. Real half bloods
are normally counted to the elves. Half-elves are very similar to
humans but a bit more focused to power and dexterity.
