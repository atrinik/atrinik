# Message file for books  
#
# Message entries contained in this file will  
# appear randomly in readable objects like books, scrolls
# and such (op->type==BOOK).
#
# To add an entry: 
# ---------------
# Start all entries w/ MSG and end with ENDMSG. The body of 
# the text between these 2 words will be the message.
#
# When designing messages please keep in mind: 
# -------------------------------------------
#    1) Message length shouldn't exceed the maximum
# buffer size for books (you'll generate a warning message
# if you do this). Check the file include/read.h for the 
# current message size limit (BOOK_BUF).
#    2) Text has to fit into the player message window.
# Don't design lines at lengths of 40 or more, or it will
# wrap around to the next line. Long lines will appear 
# differently to the player than as presented in this file.

...and then did the Alchemist agree to
make me my potion. First he called to 
his grimm servants who hauld forth a 
great iron cauldron. Into this black 
device did he deposit his ingredients
and, opening his spell book for refer-
ence, then did he cast his spell of 
alchemy therepon the cauldron. 

  Greatly did the tub shake and move!
I thought that the Alchemist had broke
his device, but he chuckled at my ig-
norance. Into the cauldron did he reach
an brought forth a filled bottle of 
golden amber fluid...
