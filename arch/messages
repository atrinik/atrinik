... and then did the Alchemist agree to make me my potion.
First he called to his grim servants who hauled forth a 
great iron cauldron. Into this black device did he deposit
his ingredients and, opening his spell book for reference,
then did he cast his spell of alchemy thereupon the cauldron. 

  Greatly did the tub shake and move!

I thought that the Alchemist had broken his device, but he
chuckled at my ignorance. Into the cauldron did he reach
an brought forth a filled bottle of golden amber fluid...

<t t="It is known...">
... that deep in the Underground City lives a demonic skeletal dragon,
whom few have seen, and even fewer survived the battle to tell the tale.
Those skillful adventurers that survived the fight brought home glorious
treasures, including the dragon's own bones, which make some kind of armour.

It is rumored that the demonic skeletal dragon has been brought to this
world from another dimension by the drow annihilator, who attempted to
summon a great warrior but failed, summoning the demonic skeletal dragon
instead, who would kill anyone who dared approach him. This is why he is
sealed inside a room in Underground City and orcs who live there tremble
at the thought of seeing the dragon.

He summoned a warrior big and strong,
but that is when he noticed something went wrong.

A mistake he made, that can't be fixed.
He did something wrong when the solution was mixed.

Vengeance is mine they could hear him say,
The dragon was here, and here to stay.

It took a while, but they sealed the beast
into a chamber, then summoned the priest.

To the King the priest must go, 
Banishing him to the depths below.

The king then ordered to be put in place,
A trap for any that try to escape.

Only one way in, to this place 
That path is not in front of your face.
