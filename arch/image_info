# This file describes the various image files installed.
# For more information on how all this works and about adding new
# image sets, see the doc/Developer/images file.
#
# The format of each line:
# num:extension:long name:fallback:geometry:extension:description
# num is the set number.
# extension is the extension that image set uses (eg, base, clsc)
# long name is just that - a longer (more english) name, eg, classic instead
#   of clsc.  This is really just used by the client for it to map the
#   image names.  Its not really intuitive for users to say -image clsc
# fallback is what set to fallback to if the image does not exist in
#   that set.  In the end, all sets must fall back to set 0.
# geometry is in width x height form.  This is used by the client so it
#   knows the spacing to use.  Images in the set could be of different
#   sizes (eg, a 4 spaces image would be larger), but this is the normal
#   spacing that the client should use.
# extension is for future use - it is passed to the client.  This is mostly
#   here so that the client can know specific information about certain
#   image sets.
# description is just a longer description that the client can display to the
#   user.
#
# NOTE: lines can not be continued with \ - everything must be on one line
#  for things to work.
# Lines that start with # are obviously ignored.
0:base:standard:0:32x32:none:The standard image set.
