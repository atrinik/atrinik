                    <message>Unfortunately, a terrible storm caught us while on our way to Strakewood, and you were knocked unconscious. The storm caused large amounts of damage to the boat, but we survived, and got washed up on this small, deserted island...</message>

However, you said the lake was atop a small hill - perhaps there is a cavern entrance somewhere on the side of the hill.
